# COVID-19-Tracker
This repository contains Python programs that pull data from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), extracts and parses the information from a .JSON file, and sends results to a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYVuHooGSPvs-nvoTRc9VrwFEylKOAGZ9w6oqV31uCE/edit?usp=sharing). The Google Spreadsheet acts as a database for mathematical analysis and graphical visualizations.
# Sample Google Spreadsheet
View the [Coronavirus Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYVuHooGSPvs-nvoTRc9VrwFEylKOAGZ9w6oqV31uCE/edit?usp=sharing) to see the Python programs in action. Updated results are pushed to the Google Spreadsheet between the hours of 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM each day.
